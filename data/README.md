* data/weather/weather_merged.csv was created by merging all the files located at <ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/gsod/2015/gsod_2015.tar> into a single file. The station columns were merged to create a single station identifier.

    | column name	| description			| data type	|
	|---------------|-----------------------|-----------|
    |STATION|This is the USAF and WBAN numbers concatenated and seperated by a '-'.|STRING|
    |YEARMODA|The Date of the weather observation|STRING|
    |TEMP|Mean temperature for the day in degrees Fahrenheit to tenths. Missing = 9999.9|FLOAT|
    |COUNT_TEMP|Number of observations used in calculating mean temperature|INTEGER|
    |DEWP|Mean dew point for the day in degreesm Fahrenheit to tenths.  Missing = 9999.9|FLOAT|
    |COUNT_DEWP|Number of observations used in calculating mean dew point|INTEGER|
    |SLP|Mean sea level pressure for the day in millibars to tenths. Missing = 9999.9|FLOAT|

    |STP|Mean station pressure for the day in millibars to tenths. Missing = 9999.9|FLOAT|
    |COUNT_STP|Number of observations used in calculating mean station pressure|INTEGER|
    |VISIB|Mean visibility for the day in miles to tenths.  Missing = 999.9|FLOAT|
    |COUNT_VISIB|Number of observations used in calculating mean visibility|INTEGER|
    |WDSP|Mean wind speed for the day in knots to tenths. Missing = 999.9|STRING|
    |COUNT_WDSP|Number of observations used in calculating mean wind speed|STRING|
    |MXSPD|Maximum sustained wind speed reported for the day in knots to tenths. Missing = 999.9|STRING|
    |GUST|Maximum wind gust reported for the day in knots to tenths. Missing = 999.9|FLOAT|
    |MAX|Maximum temperature reported during the day in Fahrenheit to tenths--time of max temp report varies by country and region, so this will sometimes not be the max for the calendar day. Missing = 9999.9. * indicates max temp was  derived from the hourly data (i.e., highest hourly or synoptic-reported temperature) otherwise max temp was taken from the explicit max temp report and not from the 'hourly' data.|STRING|
    |MIN|Minimum temperature reported during the day in Fahrenheit to tenths--time of min temp report varies by country and region, so this will sometimes not be the min for the calendar day. Missing = 9999.9* indicates min temp was  derived from the hourly data (i.e., lowest hourly or synoptic-reported temperature) otherwise min temp was taken from the explicit min temp report and not from the 'hourly' data.|STRING|
    |PRCP|Total precipitation (rain and/or melted snow) reported during the day in inches and hundredths; will usually not end with the midnight observation--i.e., may include latter part of previous day. .00 indicates no measurable precipitation (includes a trace). Missing = 99.99 Note: Many stations do not report '0' on days with no precipitation--therefore, '99.99' will often appear on these days. Also, for example, a station may only report a 6-hour amount for the period during which rain fell. See Flag field for source of data. A flag is also appended that means: A = 1 report of 6-hour precipitation amount B = Summation of 2 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount C = Summation of 3 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount D = Summation of 4 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount E = 1 report of 12-hour precipitation amount F = Summation of 2 reports of 12-hour precipitation amount G = 1 report of 24-hour precipitation amount H = Station reported '0' as the amount for the day (eg, from 6-hour reports), but also reported at least one occurrence of precipitation in hourly observations--this could indicate a trace occurred, but should be considered as incomplete data for the day. I = Station did not report any precip data for the day and did not report any occurrences of precipitation in its hourly observations--it's still possible that precip occurred but was not reported|STRING|
    |SNDP|Snow depth in inches to tenths--last report for the day if reported more thanonce. Missing = 999.9 Note: Most stations do not report '0' ondays with no snow on the ground--therefore, '999.9' will often appear on these days|FLOAT|
    |FRESHTT|A 6 character field where each character is a indicator for the following events 1. fog 2. rain or drizzle 3. snow, ice or pellets 4. hail 5. thunder 6. tornado, funnel or cloud. The meaning of each is 1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported.|STRING|

## Generated Data Files
* data/weather/weather_merged.csv - This file contains the flight data merged with the NOAA weather data for origin and destination. This file is generated in the data_munging.ipynb notebook. Columns that begin with 'OR_' are for the origin airport and columns that begin with 'DES_' are for the destination airport.

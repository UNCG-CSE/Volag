### Documentation

This folder holds the documentation for our project. Included is the progress reports for our team contributions, as well as a folder of relevant/supporting papers.

Please see the papers in `references/` that propose some interesting ideas about how to predict and analyze flight delays. We can maybe find some inspiration from these past works to help shape the direction of our project.

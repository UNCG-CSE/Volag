    Target Goals
        Analyze correlations between flight and weather features (heatmap and correlation matrix)
            Trim out features that will not be useful in our analysis
        Implement Naive Bayes classification (class : {delayed | non-delayed}, features = {temp, wdsp, dewp, etc.})
        Create other visualizations (flight delays on a map, weather patterns on a map, flight delay v. weather feature)
        Continue looking for more granular weather data

    Target Goals
        Analyze correlations between flight and weather features (heatmap and correlation matrix)
            Trim out features that will not be useful in our analysis
        Implement Naive Bayes classification (class : {delayed | non-delayed}, features = {temp, wdsp, dewp, etc.})
        Create other visualizations (flight delays on a map, weather patterns on a map, flight delay v. weather feature)
        Continue looking for more granular weather data

    Achieved Goals/Activities
        @TODO

Alex Hahn
    Target Goals
        Cleanup and document data_munging notebook
        Continue looking for improved weather data (more than once per day)
        Train a SVM using flight and weather data
        Document data files (sources, column explanations and guidance on reading)
        Check merged flight data for missing information

    Achieved Goals/Activities
        Cleanup and document data_munging notebook
